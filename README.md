# Overview

My goal was to create a Java program that serves as a random number generator with multiple options, such as coin flips and dice rolls. This project aimed to help me understand Java syntax, file handling, and user input. I wanted to create a simple yet interactive program that showcases the use of random number generation and file operations.

This project is part of my journey to learn Java and enhance my programming skills. I created a YouTube demonstration to provide a visual walkthrough of the code and showcase how the program works.

# Development Environment

- VS code Java

The program is written in Java, and it uses the built-in `Random` class for random number generation and the `Scanner` class to handle user input.

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that I found helpful during the development of this project:

# Future Work

In future iterations, I might do the following:

- Add more options in the menue for more dice types
- Implement error handling to enhance the user experience.
- Add unit tests to ensure the code's robustness.
- Change the program so that it saves which kind of coin flip you got instead of just displaying zero.
